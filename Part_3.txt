After polishing the login system, Alex was ready to merge their changes. They pushed the branch to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/login-system
Then, navigating to the repository on GitHub, Alex created a pull request. The pull request was a collaborative space where peers could review the code, suggest improvements, and celebrate the progress made. After receiving constructive feedback and making a few adjustments, the code was merged into the main branch.
